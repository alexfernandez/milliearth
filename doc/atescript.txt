Atescript
===========

Atescript is a very simple script language for MilliEarth.

Syntax
======

The syntax is also very simple, resembling natural language. The idea is to construct macros for your MilliEarth spaceships.

Examples:
  > point at closest enemy;
  > if enemy distance < 25m: point at it; shoot.

== Terminators

A statement can be terminated by several punctuation marks:
* semicolon ';'
* stop '.'

== [statement]

Can be one of the following:

* [command]
* make [variable] [value]
* if [condition]: [block].
* repeat: [block] until [condition];

== [block]

A block is one or more statements separated by semicolons ';'. Definition:
* ([statement];)+

== [command]

A direct command for the controlled robot. The general syntax is:

* [verb] ([suffix] )* ([parameter] )*

== [verb]

The verb and its suffixes are directly translated to a JavaScript function
 with the same name, joining suffixes with camelCase. For example, in the
 command:
  > point at enemy;
the verb is 'point', the suffix is 'at', and the JavaScript function will be
 pointAt().

== [parameter]

An object in general.

== [variable]

An alphanumeric identifier. Does not contain spaces or symbols, just a
 sequence of one or more letters, numbers and underscores. Regular
 expression: '\w+'.

== [magnitude]

== [condition]

Can be one of 'in', 'is'.
