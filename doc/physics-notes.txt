Physics Notes for MilliEarth
============================

MilliEarth attempts to have accurate physics for all elements.

Ionic Motor
===========

The ionic motor accelerates particles before sending them off in a direction
 opposite to the intended movement; the transfer of momentum between the
 particles and the ship causes the acceleration.

Suppose a vehicle of mass m uses an ionic motor; it expels an amount of mass
 dm per unit of time dt, so the transfer is dm/dt. Each particle is expelled
 at a speed v relative to the vehicle.

The essential variables are the mass of the particles expelled per second
 (in kg/s) and the speed of the particles (in m/s). Momentum transferred is:
  dp = dm·v => dp/dt = v·dm/dt.
while the energy required to accelerate the particles is:
  dE = dm·v²/2 => dE/dt = (1/2)·v²·dm/dt
and power is energy per second, so
  P = (1/2)·v²·dm/dt.
Finally, by the conservation of momentum the acceleration will be:
  m·dv = dm·v => m·dv/dt = v·dm/dt => a = dv/dt = (v/m)·dm/dt.

One important limitation of this kind of motor is that as the speed of the
 particles increases, so does the energy needed to generate the desired
 acceleration. In the formulas above, solving for dm/dt gives:
  a = (v/m)·2P/v² = 2P/(v·m).
so as v grows so does P, to keep a constant. The maximum thrust (force in the
 desired direction) will be delivered if the speed of the particles is the
 speed of light, c=3·10⁸m/s. But in that case the power needed will be
 ridiculously high:
  P = (1/2)·m·a·c,
and using the correct relativistic equations only makes the problem worse.
 However the amount of mass to be released per second is very small:
  dm/dt = m·a/c.

If we assume a vehicle of 200kg and a desired acceleration of ~1g (10m/s²),
 the power at the speed of light is:
  P = (1/2)·200·10·3·10⁸ = 2.94e12 kg·m²/s³ = 2.94e12 W,
or almost 3 TeraWatts. The amount of mass per second is, as expected,
 minuscule:
  dm/dt = 200·10/3·10⁸ ~ 6.7·10^(-6) kg/s,
or 6 milligrams per second.

However, keeping the speed to a more manageable value
 of 1000m/s:
  P = (1/2)·200·10·1000 = 1e6 W,
or 1MW. But in this case the amount of mass released per second is much
 larger:
  dm/dt = 200·10/1000 = 2 kg/s.

Thus ordinary ionic motors are only able to generate a very small amount of
 thrust, using reasonable power. In MilliEarth we go for a gigantic amount of
 power and mass expelled, in exchange for the higher thrusts needed to
 manoeuver in space.

Explosives
==========

In space there is no oxygen. This means that all combustive materials must
 carry their oxidant agent (O² or an equivalent) with them to burn; and all
 explosives to explode.

Contrary to my initial naïve assumptions, explosives do carry their oxidant
 with them; there is no time to react with atmospheric oxygen. In consequence,
 high power explosives carry much less energy than e.g. gasoline (or even
 butter!), but deliver it in a short fraction of a second instead of burning
 slowly. TNT in particular yields about 2.8 megajoules (MJ) per kilogram of
 explosive energy.

Today there are plastic explosives with more than twice the explosive energy
 of TNT per kg. It is safe to assume that in the future even higher
 concentrations will be common.

Now, how do explosives yield their explosive energy, and how would it affect
 a robot in a vacuum? First there is the blast wave, which in the absence of
 air would be just a rush of high-pressure, hot gas. Then the debris of the
 explosion (with the help of some shrapnel) will cause severe damage to any
 object within the blast radius.

Energy Storage
==============

The vehicle must store electric energy somehow.
